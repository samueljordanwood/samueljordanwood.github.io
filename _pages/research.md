## Working Papers
[An Empirical Analysis of the Cost of Borrowing](https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/more/2024-016) <br/>
We examine borrowing costs for firms using a security-level database with bank loans and corporate bonds issued by U.S. companies. We find significant within-firm dispersion in borrowing rates, even after controlling for security and firm observable characteristics. Obtaining a bank loan is 132 basis points cheaper than issuing a bond, after accounting for observable factors. Changes in borrowing costs have persistent negative impacts on firm-level outcomes, such as investment and borrowing, and these effects vary across sectors. These findings contribute to our understanding of borrowing costs and their implications for corporate policies and performance. <br/>
