I am a second year PhD student in economics at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/econ.html). My interests are broadly macro and public finance.

Before starting the PhD, I was a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/). I graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2021, with a B.S. in economics.
