In the Fall of 2024, I will start my PhD in economics at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/econ.html). 

Previously, I was a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/). Before that, I graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities with a B.S. in Economics and minors in Statistics and Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (Mandarin focus) in May of 2021.
